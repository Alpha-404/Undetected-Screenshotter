Adds a QS tile that when pressed takes a screenshot without alerting any apps.
Needs root access, doesent always request it and you may need to manually enable it in magisk

Android 14 only (api level 34).
To run on older versions remove the code for sharing after the screenshot is taken then compile (gradlew build)
